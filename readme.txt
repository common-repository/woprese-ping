Get all of your WordPress blogs indexed into the Woprese Search Engine. 

== Description ==

Woprese.com is a WordPress Search Engine. We index WordPress blogs so that they can be searchable via Woprese.com. The plugin will send all of your existing blogs as well as any edits or new blogs you submit.

== Frequently asked questions ==

**Will it index all of my blogs?**

Yes, all of your existing blogs as well as any edits or new blogs that you create.

**How do I turn off the Woprese Ping?**

To not send woprese.com your blog posts, simply go into the plugin and turn it off or simply deactivate it.

**Does it use a lot of server resources?**

The initial sending of existing blog posts does take up a little resources and the amount depends on how many blog posts you have. Once it's sent all the blogs, then very little resources are used. It's only used when you update a post or create a new one and then it's only sent when you click the publish link.
